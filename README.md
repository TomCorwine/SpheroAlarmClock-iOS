# Sphero Alarm Clock

This is a quick hack I put together at a hack-a-thon I attened at Twillio's San Francisco office during WWDC 2012. I had a concept for making the Sphero ball into an alarm clock, but there are certain limitations to making this work in the real world, such as the Sphero ball going to sleep without any way of making it wake up remotely.
